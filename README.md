# Diabetes-Classification-Project
This project predicts whether a patient is diabetic ('Y'), non-diabetic ('N'), or pre-diabetic ('P') using health metrics like BMI, Urea, and HbA1c. The dataset, sourced from the Mendeley Data Repository, includes 1000 patient records from Iraqi hospitals. The goal is to assist in early diabetes detection.
