# Diabetes-Classification-Project

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient is diabetic, non-diabetic, or pre-diabetic based on health metrics such as BMI, Urea, Cholesterol, and HbA1c levels.

## Project Overview

- **Problem Type**: Multiclass Classification
- **Objective**: To classify patients into 'Diabetic (Y)', 'Non-Diabetic (N)', or 'Pre-Diabetic (P)' using several machine learning models.

## Files in the Repository

- **diabetes_classification_notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning model implementations.
- **dataset.csv**: The dataset used for this classification problem.
- **README.md**: This file, providing a brief overview of the project.

## Machine Learning Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (Best performing model)

## Results
The best performing model was **XGBoost**, which achieved high accuracy and strong precision, recall, and F1-scores.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Diabetes-Classification-Project.git
